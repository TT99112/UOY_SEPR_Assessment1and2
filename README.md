# UOY_SEPR_Assessment1and2
Software Engineering Project for University of York Computer Science Stage 2 (2019-2020)

## Overview
This repository contains the source code for the first assessment and second assessment of our software engineering project at the University of York. The project involves developing a game using Java and the LibGDX framework. The game challenges players to manage firetrucks strategically to defend the city from extraterrestrial threats.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Java 11 or higher
- LibGDX framework (included as a dependency)

# Game Description
Players command a fleet of firetrucks to protect the city by positioning them strategically around the map. Each firetruck has unique specifications such as speed, water capacity, and health. Players must use their resources wisely to prevent the city from being overrun by aliens.

## Features
- **Strategic gameplay:** Position firetrucks around the city to defend against aliens.
- **Dynamic threats:** The strength and frequency of alien attacks increase as the game progresses.
- **Resource management:** Manage firetrucks' health and water supply.
- **Intuitive user interface:** Simple controls and clear, informative GUI.
- **Embedded minigame:** Offers a break from the main gameplay with thematic consistency.
